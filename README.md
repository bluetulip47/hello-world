hello-world
===========

Because you can't say "hello, world!" often enough.

I began building html websites and learning C++ back in 2001-2002, and have been messing around with any technologies I can get my hands on since (well, ok, I took a hiatus to do that college thing without majoring in CS). I'm pretty epic with PHP, fairly comfortable with javascript (and jQuery) and MySQL, ok at CSS, and currently on a kick of learning more 'advanced' javascript applications; specifically Node.js and MongoDB as of October 2014.
